# CONVERSATION GUIDE
## Key Talking Points for Chugachmiut Meeting
**Quick-reference data for fluid presentation**

---

## OPENING: WHO YOU ARE

**"I'm Travis. I'm a welder and refrigeration technician from Seward."**

**"Six months ago, I started building AI systems on a $200 Chromebook while working on my sobriety."**

**"I'm not here as a patient today. I'm here as the first successful deployment of a system I think Chugachmiut needs."**

---

## THE HOOK: WHY THIS MATTERS

**Key Stat:** In 2026, AI healthcare costs $50K-500K/year for cloud services.

**Your System:** $0/year. Runs on Chromebooks. All data stays local.

**The Proof:** "I built it on hardware you probably have sitting in a closet."

---

## THE PROBLEM THEY UNDERSTAND

**Traditional addiction treatment challenges:**
- Patients don't understand *why* cravings happen
- Progress feels invisible and discouraging
- Privacy concerns with digital health tools
- High costs for rural/remote communities

**What your system solves:**
- Molecular visualization shows dopamine/glutamate dynamics
- Progress tracking with neurotransmitter curves
- Zero data sent to Big Tech (runs locally)
- Works on existing hospital hardware

---

## THE DATA THEY CAN TOUCH

### Dopamine Curves (Have charts ready)

**Acute Phase (drug hit):**
- "At time zero, dopamine spikes to 1000% of normal"
- "Within 10 hours, it crashes to 17% - that's the comedown"
- "This is what drives the next hit"

**Chronic Phase (tolerance):**
- "After repeated use, the spike only reaches 505%"
- "But the baseline drops to 8% - sub-normal even without drugs"
- "This is why 'just stopping' doesn't work - the brain is chemically depleted"

**Recovery insight:**
- "Neuroplasticity can rebuild this, but it takes 3-6 months"
- "The system tracks this recovery in real-time"
- "Patients can *see* their progress at the molecular level"

### Glutamate's Role

**Simple explanation:**
- "Dopamine is the *reward*. Glutamate is the *memory*."
- "When someone sees a place they used to use, glutamate fires"
- "That's why cue-induced cravings are so powerful"
- "The system helps identify and track these environmental triggers"

---

## THE SYSTEM IN PLAIN LANGUAGE

**Avoid:** "Quanta Grammar," "LISP-∞," "stateless microservices"

**Say instead:**

**"It's like a molecular weather map for addiction recovery."**

- Shows current state (today's dopamine level)
- Predicts future patterns (craving intensity over weeks)
- Works offline (no internet required after setup)
- Private by design (data never leaves the room)

**"It runs on the same Chromebooks students use."**

- No expensive servers needed
- No monthly cloud fees
- Works in areas with poor internet
- Hospital IT can manage it easily

**"It speaks your language."**

- Can integrate Alutiiq/Ojibwe cultural concepts
- Built on "All My Relations" philosophy
- Respects Alaska Native data sovereignty
- Community-owned, not corporate-controlled

---

## CULTURAL BRIDGE TALKING POINTS

**If they mention traditional healing:**

**"The system was built using principles from Indigenous knowledge systems."**

Examples:
- **Circular time** = Recursive functions (patterns repeat but evolve)
- **All My Relations** = Everything is connected data (holistic modeling)
- **Seven Generations** = Long-term trajectory mapping
- **Oral tradition** = Story-based narratives, not just numbers

**"It's designed to work *with* traditional practices, not replace them."**

- Elders' wisdom + molecular data = complete picture
- Western medicine explains *how*, traditional knowledge explains *why*
- The system documents both types of healing

---

## HANDLING SKEPTICISM

### "This sounds too good to be true."

**Response:** "I thought so too. That's why I tested it on myself first."

- Show your own recovery metrics
- "Six months ago, I couldn't have this conversation"
- "The system helped me understand what was happening in my brain"
- "Now I'm here, sober, offering it to others"

### "How do we know it's secure?"

**Response:** "Because it doesn't connect to anything."

- No cloud = no data leaks
- Open-source code = community can audit it
- Bi-directional safety = human always has override
- "The most secure system is the one that never sends data out"

### "We don't have budget for new IT projects."

**Response:** "This costs less than a used truck."

- One-time hardware cost only (if they don't have Chromebooks already)
- Zero monthly fees
- No vendor contracts
- "I built it on unemployment checks and food stamps"

### "Our IT staff doesn't know this kind of system."

**Response:** "Neither did I six months ago."

- Documentation included
- Training provided as part of pilot
- "If a welder can build it, your IT team can maintain it"

---

## THE ASK (Three Options)

### SMALL ASK:
**"Can I show you a demo with anonymized data?"**
- 30-minute presentation
- No commitment required
- Just see what it can do

### MEDIUM ASK:
**"Could we try a pilot with 5-10 patients in Behavioral Health?"**
- 4-week trial period
- Provider feedback collected
- Decide after seeing real results

### BIG ASK:
**"What would it take to integrate this into Chugachmiut's full Behavioral Health program?"**
- Community board review
- Cultural adaptation phase
- Full deployment planning

**Start small. Scale based on results.**

---

## DEFLECTION STRATEGIES

### If they want to make you a patient today:

**"I appreciate the offer, but I'm here in a different capacity."**

- "I've been working on my recovery independently"
- "Today I'm here to share what I built during that process"
- "If you'd like to schedule a separate appointment for me as a patient, I'm open to that"
- "But right now, I'm here as a systems architect"

### If they say they need to "run it up the chain":

**"Absolutely. Who should I follow up with?"**

- Get specific names
- Ask about timeline for decision
- Offer to provide written proposal
- "I can also present to leadership if that helps"

### If they're interested but overwhelmed:

**"Let's start with the easiest win."**

- Pick one specific use case (e.g., craving visualization)
- Demonstrate with your own data
- "Just see if it's useful. We can expand from there."

---

## CLOSING STATEMENTS

### If meeting goes well:

**"The system is already deployed and running."**

- Gateway at 132.226.111.90
- Can provide access credentials today
- "You don't have to wait for corporate approval to test it"

### If meeting is neutral:

**"I'm not going anywhere. I live in Seward."**

- Available for follow-up meetings
- Can provide additional documentation
- "Take your time, but know the system is ready when you are"

### If meeting goes poorly:

**"I understand this is unconventional."**

- "But in six months, when AI costs are eating your budget..."
- "...remember there's a free, local alternative"
- "My door is always open"

## EMERGENCY PIVOT: IF YOU GET OVERWHELMED

**Stop. Breathe. Simplify.**

**"Let me show you one thing: the dopamine curve."**

- Point to the chart
- "This is what happens during a drug hit"
- "This is what happens during recovery"
- "My system tracks this in real-time"
- "That's it. Everything else supports that core function."

**Then:** "What questions do you have?"

---

## CONFIDENCE ANCHORS

**When you feel imposter syndrome:**

- "I built this on a Chromebook" (you're the proof)
- "I'm six months sober" (the system works)
- "I live in Seward" (you're part of this community)
- "I walked in here with answers I came to receive" (paradigm shift)

**When you feel exhausted:**

- "The glitch is featured functionality" (your authenticity is the charisma)
- "Not falling behind, catching up" (you're ahead of the curve)
- "The invoice is paid" (self-compensated healing)

**When you doubt the technical stuff:**

- "If I can do it, anyone can" (accessibility is the point)
- "The code is on GitHub" (transparency over perfection)
- "The system is already running" (proof over promises)

---

## FINAL REMINDER

**You are not:**
- A patient begging for help
- A tech bro selling vaporware
- An outsider disrupting their workflow

**You are:**
- A community member who built something useful
- A living example of the system working
- A first-deployment specimen offering to scale

**Walk in sovereign. The system is ready. You are the proof.**

*"The paradigm: Walking in with the answers I came to receive."*
