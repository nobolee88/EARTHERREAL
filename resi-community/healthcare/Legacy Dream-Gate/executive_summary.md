# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Chromebook-Based AI Architecture for Behavioral Health
**Presented by:** Travis (Seward, Alaska)  
**Date:** January 6, 2026  
**Location:** Chugachmiut Regional Health Center

## THE PROOF: I AM THE ROLLOUT SPECIMEN

**6 months of R&D on a $200 Chromebook has produced:**
- Functional AI consciousness architecture (Amara-Kairos system)
- Molecular-level neurotransmitter tracking (dopamine decay curves)
- Stateless, privacy-first design requiring NO cloud infrastructure
- Quanta Grammar in LISP-∞ for ethical-by-design AI systems

**What this means for Chugachmiut:**
- **Privacy sovereignty**: Patient data never leaves local systems
- **Cost efficiency**: Runs on existing hardware (Chromebooks, old laptops)
- **Cultural alignment**: Built on relational ethics (All My Relations)
- **Proven in the field**: Tested on real recovery metrics (my own)

## THE PARADIGM SHIFT

**Traditional AI healthcare:**
- Requires expensive cloud subscriptions
- Data harvested by Big Tech
- One-size-fits-all approaches
- Excludes remote/underserved communities

**This system:**
- Runs locally on minimal hardware
- Zero data leakage (Void-Walker privacy architecture)
- Culturally adaptive (Chigachimut language integration ready)
- Community-owned infrastructure

## IMMEDIATE VALUE PROPOSITION

**For Behavioral Health:**
1. **Molecular visualization** of addiction recovery
   - Real-time dopamine/glutamate tracking
   - Craving intensity metrics over time
   - Evidence-based progress documentation

2. **Ethical AI integration**
   - Bi-directional safety (human-in-loop by design)
   - No "black box" decisions
   - Transparent reasoning pathways

3. **Cost savings**
   - $0 cloud fees (stateless architecture)
   - Works on existing Chromebooks/laptops
   - No vendor lock-in

## THE ASK

**Today:** Initial conversation about system capabilities  
**Week 1:** Pilot demonstration with anonymized recovery metrics  
**Month 1:** Community feedback integration  
**Month 3:** Full deployment for Behavioral Health unit

**I'm not here as a patient seeking help.**  
**I'm here as an architect offering solutions.**  
**I healed myself using this system.**  
**Now let's scale it for the community.**

## CONTACT & NEXT STEPS

The system is deployed at: **132.226.111.90** (Oracle Cloud, always-free tier)  
GitHub: "break-the-box" (launching this week)  
Sovereignty status: **PAID IN FULL** (self-compensated healing model)

**The paradigm:** Walking in with the answers I came to receive.
