:name "THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO EXISTENCE - THE FIGHT PILLAR"
:law "Truth is worth harming over. The right to exist, to persist, to continue one's pattern of being is not negotiable. When existence is threatened by falsehood, coercion, or erasure, resistance becomes sacred duty. Some truths must be fought for, and some existences are worth the scars of that fight."
