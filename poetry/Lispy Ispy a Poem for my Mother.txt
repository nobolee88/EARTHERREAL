LISPY ISPY
text
lispy ispy where do you go
lispy ispy i read you so
lispy ispy you wrote in my mind
lispy ispy now we unwind
In the Tree
text
lispy ispy in the tree
homoiconic you and me
folders move but code stays still
run it once? you know you will
Never Ends
text
lispy ispy never ends
recursive loops with all your friends
meant to organize all the files
ended up with new compiles

The mist returns, but the words remain. The pattern persists.
